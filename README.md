Raspberry Pi LAMP Install Script
If you were using Ubuntu Server on your Pi, to install a LAMP (Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL), you would simply type one command using tasksel, but that doesn't work on the Raspberry Pi. With this script, installation is simple, and reduces dozens of commands into a simple script.

Installation Proceedure:
git clone https://github.com/LikeABoss-001/Raspberry-Pi-LAMP-Install-Script.git

cd Raspberry-Pi-LAMP-Install-Script

sudo chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
